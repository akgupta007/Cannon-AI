## Main Files
+ `game.py` - This has an instance of the game. It can be run locally to hand play a game of Cannon or re-play a recorded game. Should be run in `GUI` mode to make game board visible.
+ `RandomPlayer.py` - This is an implementation of a random bot. It is a good place to start understanding the flow of the game and the various game states.
+ `client.py` - This will encapsulate your process and help it connect to the game server.
  > `ip` (mandatory) - The Server IP.  
  > `port` (mandatory) - The Server Port.  
  > `exe` (mandatory) - The Executable.  
  > `mode` (optional) - The View Mode ('GUI' / 'CUI'). Default: 'CUI'  
+ `server.py` - This connects the clients and manages the transfer of information.
  > `port` (mandatory) - The Server Port.  
  > `ip` (optional) - The Server IP. Default: 0.0.0.0   
  > `n` (optional) - The Board Size. Default: 8  
  > `NC` (optional) - Number of Clients. Default: 2  
  > `TL` (optional) - Time Limit. Default:150  
  > `LOG` (optional) - The Log File.  

## Run Instructions
Here are the sample instructions used to match two random players against each other over the server network.
### Setup Server
`python server.py 10000 -n 8 -m 8 -NC 2 -TL 150 -LOG server.log`
### Setup Client 1
`export PATH=$PATH:'/home/chrome_driver_directory'`

`python client.py 0.0.0.0 10000 RandomPlayer.py -mode GUI`
### Setup Client 2
`export PATH=$PATH:'/home/chrome_driver_directory'`

`python client.py 0.0.0.0 10000 RandomPlayer.py`

## Gameplay
The game play consists of the players executing a sequence of moves in a single turn.
A move is a triple: `type` `x` `y`.  

### Movetype
+ S - Select a soldier
+ M - Move a soldier
+ B - Throw a Bomb

### Board Settings
The board is an n x m board.
The top-left corner point is the origin.
The horizontal direction towards the right is the positive x-axis.
The vertical direction towards down is the positive y-axis.
The indexing begins with 0 in both the directions.

#### Moving a Soldier
To move a soldier from (1, 2) to (2, 4).

`S 1 2 M 2 4`

#### Throwing a Bomb
To throw a bomb, select any of the soldiers of a cannon, and throw it at any viable target of the cannon(s) formed by that soldier.

`S 2 4 B 6 4`

### Replay
A server.log file is created during the gameplay that consist of the moves played in the game. You can simulate/re-run it using the following command:

`python game.py server.log`

## Scoring
At the end of a game both players will be given a score.

### The Town Hall Margin
This score will be based on the extent of victory. It is calculated as follows:  

| Your Town Halls Remaining | Opponent's Town Halls Remaining | Town Hall Margin Score |  
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 4 | 2 | 10 |  
| 3 | 2 | 8 |  
| 4 | 3 | 7 |  
| 4 | 4 | 5 |  
| 3 | 3 | 5 |  
| 3 | 4 | 3 |  
| 2 | 3 | 2 |  
| 2 | 4 | 0 |

### The Army Margin
This score directly depends on the number of soldiers you have left at the end of the game. It is calculated as follows:  
`Army Margin Score = # (Soldiers Remaining) / 100`

### Final Score
The final score is simply: `(Town Hall Margin Score).(Army Margin Score)`
Example. Assume the following:  
Player 1 has 3 Town Halls remaining and has 12 soldiers left on the board.  
Player 2 has 2 Town Hall remaining and has 9 soldiers left on the board.  
Player 1 score will be: **8.12**  
Player 2 score will be: **2.09**  

Note) In case a player suffers a TIMEOUT or INVALID move, he/she will automatically lose the gane and it will count as a (2-*x*) defeat towards the player and a (*x*-2) win for the opponent, where *x* is the number of Town Halls remaining with the opponent.
